## Introduction

The **ML-task** project demonstrates essential steps in a machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, training, and evaluation. It is a practical resource for understanding Python-based machine learning workflows.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RUKUNDO-Prince/ML-task.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ML-task
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
